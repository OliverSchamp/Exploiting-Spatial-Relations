# Exploiting-Spatial-Relations

## Overview

Using Transformers for Object Detection in Foosball. This is a GitHub repostiory for my thesis "Exploiting Spatial Relations for Object Detection with Transformers". Two models, DETR and RetinaNet, were trained on foosball data, once with a single figure class, and once with positional classes. The Detection Transformer (DETR) showed better performance on synthetic data for positionally labelled classes on synthetic data. For results, see the thesis PDF in this repo.

## Folders

datasets: the dataloader classes used for the training of both models  
RetinaNet: experiments done running RetinaNet  
detr_experiments: experiments done running DETR  
Segmentsai: named after the software I used, this contains the scripts to import the hand-labelled foosball data, and also the synthesiser for the synthetic data  
models: DETR model classes, I did not edit this  
utils: DETR utils, I did not edit this  
test_images: a few examples of outputs  

### Other important files

engine.py: contains the DETR evaluator class  
plot_final_bar.py: creates my final bar plot from a hard-coded list  

## Reproducibility

This section associates the experimental scripts with the Figures in my thesis PDF.
